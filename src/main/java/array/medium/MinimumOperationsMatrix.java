/**
 * Minimum Operation of Given Type to Make all Elements of a Matrix Equal
 *
 * <p>Problem Statement Given an integer K and a matrix of N rows and M columns, the task is to find
 * the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the matrix equal. In a
 * single operation, K can be added to or subtracted from any element of the matrix.
 *
 * <p>Example 1: Input:
 *
 * <p>A = [[0, 2, 8],
 *
 * <p>[8, 2, 0],
 *
 * <p>[0, 2, 8]]
 *
 * <p>K = 2
 *
 * <p>Output:
 *
 * <p>12
 *
 * <p>Constraints: 1 <= N, M <= 1000
 *
 * <p>1 <= | A | <= 105
 *
 * <p>1 <= Ai <= 105
 *
 * <p>1 <= k <= 104
